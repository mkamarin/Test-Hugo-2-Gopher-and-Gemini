Step 1. Install Hugo


Go to Hugo releases [1] and download the appropriate  version for your
OS and architecture.

Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.

More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo [2]

Step 2. Build the Docs


Hugo   has  its  own  example  site  which  happens  to  also  be  the
documentation site you are reading right now.

Follow the following steps:

 1. Clone the Hugo repository [3]
 2. Go into the repo
 3. Run hugo in server mode and build the docs
 4. Open your browser to http://localhost:1313

Corresponding pseudo commands:

i    git clone https://github.com/spf13/hugo	/
i    cd hugo	/
i    /path/to/where/you/installed/hugo server --source=./docs	/
i    > 29 pages created	/
i    > 0 tags index created	/
i    > in 27 ms	/
i    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313	/
i    > Press ctrl+c to stop	/

Once you've  gotten  here, follow along the  rest of this page on your
local build.

Step 3. Change the docs site


Stop the Hugo process by hitting Ctrl+C.

Now we are going to run hugo again,  but  this time with hugo in watch
mode.

i    /path/to/hugo/from/step/1/hugo server --source=./docs --watch	/
i    > 29 pages created	/
i    > 0 tags index created	/
i    > in 27 ms	/
i    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313	/
i    > Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content	/
i    > Press ctrl+c to stop	/


Open your favorite editor [4]  and change  one  of  the source content
pages. How  about changing this very file to  fix the typo.  How about
changing this very file to fix the typo.

Content files  are found in`docs/content/` Unless otherwise specified,
files are located at  the  same relative  location as the  url, in our
case`docs/content/overview/quickstart.md`

Change and save this file.. Notice what happened in your terminal.

i    > Change detected, rebuilding site	/

i    > 29 pages created	/
i    > 0 tags index created	/
i    > in 26 ms	/

Refresh the browser and observe that the typo is now fixed.

Notice how  quick  that  was.  Try to  refresh the  site  before  it's
finished building. I  double dare you.  Having nearly instant feedback
enables  you to have your  creativity flow  without waiting  for  long
builds.

Step 4. Have fun


The best way to learn something is to play with it.
