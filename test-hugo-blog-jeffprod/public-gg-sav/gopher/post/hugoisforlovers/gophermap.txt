i
i## Step 1. Install Hugo
i
iGo to [Hugo releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) and download the
iappropriate version for your OS and architecture.
i
iSave it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
i
iMore complete instructions are available at [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
i
i## Step 2. Build the Docs
i
iHugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site
iyou are reading right now.
i
iFollow the following steps:
i
i 1. Clone the [Hugo repository](http://github.com/spf13/hugo)
i 2. Go into the repo
i 3. Run hugo in server mode and build the docs
i 4. Open your browser to http://localhost:1313
i
iCorresponding pseudo commands:
i
i    git clone https://github.com/spf13/hugo
i    cd hugo
i    /path/to/where/you/installed/hugo server --source=./docs
i    > 29 pages created
i    > 0 tags index created
i    > in 27 ms
i    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313
i    > Press ctrl+c to stop
i
iOnce you've gotten here, follow along the rest of this page on your local build.
i
i## Step 3. Change the docs site
i
iStop the Hugo process by hitting Ctrl+C.
i
iNow we are going to run hugo again, but this time with hugo in watch mode.
i
i    /path/to/hugo/from/step/1/hugo server --source=./docs --watch
i    > 29 pages created
i    > 0 tags index created
i    > in 27 ms
i    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313
i    > Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content
i    > Press ctrl+c to stop
i
i
iOpen your [favorite editor](http://vim.spf13.com) and change one of the source
icontent pages. How about changing this very file to *fix the typo*. How about changing this very file to *fix the typo*.
i
iContent files are found in `docs/content/`. Unless otherwise specified, files
iare located at the same relative location as the url, in our case
i`docs/content/overview/quickstart.md`.
i
iChange and save this file.. Notice what happened in your terminal.
i
i    > Change detected, rebuilding site
i
i    > 29 pages created
i    > 0 tags index created
i    > in 26 ms
i
iRefresh the browser and observe that the typo is now fixed.
i
iNotice how quick that was. Try to refresh the site before it's finished building. I double dare you.
iHaving nearly instant feedback enables you to have your creativity flow without waiting for long builds.
i
i## Step 4. Have fun
i
iThe best way to learn something is to play with it.
