# Hello world!

This is an abbreviation **<abbr title="Do it yourself">DIY</abbr>**.

A **quote**:

> Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Steve Francia originally created Hugo as an open source project in 2013. Since v0.14 in 2015, Hugo has continued development under the lead of Bjørn Erik Pedersen with other contributors. Hugo is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.  Hugo is particularly noted for its speed, and Hugo's official website states it is "the world’s fastest framework for building websites". In July 2015, Netlify began providing Hugo hosting. Notable adopters are Smashing Magazine, which migrated from WordPress to a JAMstack solution with Hugo in and in 2017, and Cloudflare, which switched its Developer Docs from Gatsby to Hugo in 2022.
