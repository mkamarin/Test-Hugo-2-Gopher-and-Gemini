Hel Peninsula [1] (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is  a 35-km-long sand  bar
peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay  of Puck from the open
Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m
near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the
tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently
turned into  an island  by winter storms. Until the  17th  century the
peninsula was  a  chain of islands that  formed a  strip of land  only
during the summer.
