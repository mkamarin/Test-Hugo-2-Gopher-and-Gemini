Hugo  is  an  open-source  project  and  lives  by  the  work  of  its
contributors.  There are plenty  of open issues, and we need your help
to make Hugo even  more awesome. You  don't need  to be a Go  guru  to
contribute to the project's development.

Assumptions


This contribution  guide  takes  a  step-by-step approach in  hopes of
helping newcomers. Therefore, we only assume the following:

* You are new to Git or open-source projects in general
* You are  a  fan  of Hugo and enthusiastic  about contributing  to  the
  project

Install Go


The installation of Go should  take only a few minutes. You  have more
than one option to get Go up and running on your machine.

If you  are having  trouble  following the installation guides for Go,
check out Go Bootcamp,  which contains  setups for every  platform  or
reach out to the Hugo community in the Hugo Discussion Forums.

Install Go From Source


Download the latest stable version  of Go  and follow the official  Go
installation guide.

Once  you're  finished  installing  Go, let's  confirm  everything  is
working  correctly. Open a terminal---or command  line under Windows--
and type the following:

igo version	/

You  should see something  similar  to the  following  written  to the
console. Note that  the version here  reflects the most recent version
of Go as of the last update for this page:

igo version go1.12 darwin/amd64	/

Next,  make  sure  that you  set  up your`GOPATH`as  described  in the
installation guide.

You can print the`GOPATH`with`echo $GOPATH` You should see a non-empty
string containing a valid path to your Go workspace; for example:

i/Users/<yourusername>/Code/go	/
